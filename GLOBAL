# GlyphGuardian — Global Deployment Vision 🌍

---

## Mission Statement

GlyphGuardian is designed to protect users worldwide against domain spoofing, phishing, and character-based deception attacks.  
Our goal is to make clean, human-readable internet navigation **a global standard** — regardless of language, country, or industry.

## Why Global?

- **Homograph attacks** are a worldwide threat.
- Unicode-based character spoofing affects domains, emails, and services in *every country*.
- Every user deserves clean, safe access to digital services — *without fear or confusion*.
