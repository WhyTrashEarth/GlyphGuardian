# GlyphGuardian

**Lightweight Unicode homograph detection system.**

GlyphGuardian aims to protect users from deceptive link spoofing attacks by detecting suspicious characters that look similar to trusted domains.

This project is part of WhyTrashEarth-Projects.

## Project Goal

Help prevent phishing and identity spoofing by alerting users when a link contains suspicious Unicode characters that mimic trusted sites.

---

## How It Works (Concept)

- Scans domain names for lookalike characters
- Compares against trusted whitelisted domains
- Flags or blocks suspicious links before users click

## Author's Note

Hello friends and security enthusiasts!!! I randomly thought of this idea when I was thinking about my love of fonts and this hit me! 
Imagine a system like a browser extension or something knows what a Unicode value should be for a popular word like YouTube(dot)com 
and if someone was swapping letters to try and spoof the link the GlyphGuardian would instantly detect, notify or prevent the user from actually entering a malicious link.
I understand there are prompts on certain browsers or email providers that say "are you sure?" most people don't care about that... 
It needs to be a specific and realisitically detected threat and finding text is super easy. 
Feel free to reach out if you have any questions... It is my sincere intention this helps others and maybe we can develop this one day. :)

Stay Super Awesome
