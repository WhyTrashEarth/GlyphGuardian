# GlyphGuardian

**Lightweight Unicode homograph detection system.**

GlyphGuardian aims to protect users from deceptive link spoofing attacks by detecting suspicious characters that mimic trusted domains.

This project is part of WhyTrashEarth-Projects.

## Why It Matters

Every year, billions are lost to phishing attacks â€” many of them using invisible tricks like Unicode domain spoofing.  
GlyphGuardian is a lightweight defense designed to catch these tricks before they catch you.

---

## How It Works

- Scans domain names for lookalike Unicode characters
- Compares against trusted whitelisted domains
- Flags, blocks, or warns users before danger

---

## Example Threat

- Trusted Domain: `youtube.com`
- Spoofed Domain: `Ñƒoutube.com` *(Cyrillic "Ñƒ" instead of Latin "y")*

**Both look the same â€” but one could steal your information.**

GlyphGuardian stops this before you click.

## Future Plans

We aim to expand GlyphGuardian beyond browsers to email clients like Outlook and Thunderbird.  
Eventually, lightweight desktop apps will be created for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

- Typosquatting Detection â€” Identify links that use common misspellings (e.g., "porkbunt.com" instead of "porkbun.com").
- Future Feature: Subdomain Deception Detection â€” Warn users about tricky subdomain structures (e.g., "porkbun.com-products.domains").
