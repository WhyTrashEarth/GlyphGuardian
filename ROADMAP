## Introduction

GlyphGuardian is an open-source initiative to protect users from homograph (lookalike character) attacks across websites, emails, and more.  
Our mission is to make identity spoofing obvious, prevent costly breaches, and make the Internet a safer place for everyone.

## Stage Plan

| Stage | Goal | Status |
|:------|:-----|:------|
| 1 | Research Unicode + homograph detection methods | Researching |
| 2 | Develop initial Chromium Extension (Chrome, Brave, Edge) | Planning |
| 3 | Develop initial Firefox Extension | Planning |
| 4 | Expand to lightweight desktop app (Windows, macOS) for link protection in emails and apps | Future |
| 5 | Investigate Linux (Thunderbird integration, Evolution, KMail) | Future |
| 6 | Explore lightweight mobile app/browser plugin versions (Android/iOS) | Future |

## Extra Future Goals

- **Whitelist System:** Allow trusted companies (e.g., Porkbun, GitHub) to register safe character sets and known domains.
- **Enterprise Dashboard:** Allow companies to track alerts internally.
- **Silent Canary Tokens:** Allow silent alerts if major spoof attempts are detected inside organizations.
